import json
from recipes.models import Recipe

with open('recipes.json') as f:
   recipe_json = json.load(f)
   
for recipe in recipe_json:
   recipe = Recipe(title=recipe['title'], ingredients=recipe['ingredients'], cooking_steps=recipe['cooking_steps'],date_created=recipe['date_created'], cook_time=recipe['cook_time'],prep_time=recipe['prep_time'], author_id=recipe['author'])
   recipe.save()
